# BookTrade

BookTrade is a web application created for SFU students to buy and sell used textbooks. Users can create accounts, sell books, create wishlists, and message other sellers to buy books. The SFU Course Outline API was used to populate BookTrade's database with real course data, allowing users to search for required textbooks by name or any combination of course information. The project was created using HTML, CSS, SQL, PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, and phpMyAdmin. BookTrade was also developed to be mobile-friendly.

Created by SFU students Brittany Ryan and Michael Gergely. For any inquries please email either beryan@sfu.ca or mgergely@sfu.ca.
